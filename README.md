# My Vimfiles

This repo is for my personal .vimrc (or _vimrc, as it were), plus my vimfiles.

It also includes:

- everyday.ahk, the Autohotkey script I use daily
- vim-style-caps-lock.ahk, an AHK script to make it so you can use vim-style navigation in any program by holding caps lock
- an export of my WinSplitRevolution settings which I use to manage windows on multiple monitors
